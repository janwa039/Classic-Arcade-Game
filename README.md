### Rules
The game board consists of sixteen cards which are randomly arranged with the cards faced down everytime the player starts or restarts the game or even reloads the page. Each row and column is made up four cards each. The game board  is made up of eight different pairs of cards (making it 16cards all together). 

#### Playing

The rules are very simple:
  Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match

During Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal the symbol under.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
