* The enemies (bugs) move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
* The player must reach the water without colliding into any of the bugs.
* You have unlimited lives and by colliding with any bug, you will lose a live
* Every time the player reaches the water the character moves back to the start position and starts the next level(there are up to 3 levels before the game ends).
* You only win when you get to level 3 and finish that level, it is all about trying not to loose as many lives as possible before the game ends which is after level 3. HAVE FUN!!!
